# README Generator 

## Introduction
This project gave me great insight on how user-interaction is an important factor in creating any project. The README Generator is meant to make it much easier to create a README file for your project. As it already formats the text to follow the standard of a regular “README.md”  file, which you can just plug into your project once submitting the text you want to fit into your project. As simple as a 2 minute questionnaire can get you a jumpstart into fully creating a submittable project.

## How the project was accomplished
 This project was created using node and various modules of node.js. For the most part, the questionnaire was used with the inquirer module, and the readme creation was made possible using the fs module. All of the questions were developed from common README file structures found from information provided online. Node (and its corresponding modules) as well as a bit of Javascript, made readme file creation easy to be developed in just a few minutes.

## Installation Guide
 Installation is easy in this sense, in that all you need is this code. Once you download this code, a simple “node index.js” command on your nearest terminal, and you’re on your way to a new README file.

## Usability
 This projects use is meant to be for anyone who needs a README file for their project posted on Github. It is intended to make it easier to follow and create the READMe in half the time it takes you to format the README.
